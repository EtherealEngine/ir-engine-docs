This guide outlines the fundamental Viewport navigation controls using a mouse and keyboard.

## About the Viewport

The **Viewport** is your main workspace in the Studio. It displays all active entities in your scene and acts as a window into your virtual world, where you can navigate, preview, and edit the elements of your scene in real time.
