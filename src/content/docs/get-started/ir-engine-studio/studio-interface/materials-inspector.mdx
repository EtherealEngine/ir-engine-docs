import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The **Materials** **inspector** is your central hub for manipulating the materials on a model or entities. It offers a robust set of tools for fine-tuning the look and feel of objects in your scene. You can import textures, tweak properties, and input various maps to achieve lifelike results on the web.

## Manage entity materials

To manage the materials of your entities in your scene, follow these steps:

<Steps>

1. **Select your entity:** Choose an entity in the **Hierarchy** panel.
2. **View its materials:** Navigate to the **Materials** tab to view a list of all materials currently applied to the selected entity.
3. **Adjust its properties:** Modify the properties of each material within the **Properties** panel under **Materials**.

</Steps>

## Material prototypes

The engine offers extensive support for various materials, each catering to specific visual requirements. These materials provide a foundation for creating various surface effects.

We recommend you use **MeshPhysicalMaterial** for transparent materials or objects that require Clearcoat like car paint.

Choose between different prototypes in the **Properties** panel:
