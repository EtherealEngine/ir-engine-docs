The **Hierarchy** panel serves as the foundation for structuring your scene. It provides a comprehensive view of all **entities** within your project, which are the building blocks that bring your scene to life. These entities can range from geometric shapes to abstract elements like lighting and effects.

## Entity categories

The creation process offers a variety of categories to suit your needs. You can choose from:

| Category | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Empty | Inserts an empty entity to your hierarchy that you can build components on. |
| Geo | Add a model component where you can input a 3D file, select a basic primitive shape, or add a ground plane to your scene. |
| Lighting | Add various lights to your scene. Choose from point lights, spotlights, directional lights, ambient lights, or hemisphere lights. |
| Collider | Define the collision shape of an entity for physics interactions. Options include box, sphere, cylinder, and mesh colliders. |
| Text | Insert non-interactive text elements into your scene. Text entities are useful for titles, labels, instructions, captions, or other informational content. |
| LookDev | LookDev entities influence the overall visual style of your scene, including the skybox, fog, and post-processing effects. |

By effectively utilizing the **Hierarchy** panel, you can establish a well-organized scene structure, making it easier to manage and manipulate your virtual world.
