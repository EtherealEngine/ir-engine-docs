This guide walks you through viewing and creating a scene in your project.

## About scenes

In iR Engine, a project can contain multiple scenes, allowing you to meet a range of project needs within a single domain. A scene is an entity hierarchy that holds all the entities, assets, and components that make up the parts of your project.

## Access the scenes collection

You can access your project’s scenes in the iR Engine in two ways: from the **Console**, and from the **Studio**. The following sections describe each option.

### View scenes from the Console

The My Projects page in the Studio provides an overview of all your projects. Each project displays the scene(s) associated with it in a thumbnail. After opening a scene, you can update a scene thumbnail by updating the **scene preview camera** inside the Studio.

### View scenes from the Studio

Locate the **Scenes** tab at the bottom left of the browser. This tab opens a panel showing the collection of existing scenes associated with the project you are currently working on.

3. Optionally, you can rename your scene using the three-dot menu (**…**) on the scene thumbnail for better organization.

</Steps>

After creating your scene, it automatically becomes active, and you can start building your experience.

## Next steps

Now that you have created your first scene in your project, you can proceed to [load assets into your scene](/scene-development/working-with-assets/load-assets-into-scenes) to build your experience.
