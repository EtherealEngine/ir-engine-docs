### Summary

This inaugural release of the iR Engine lays the foundation for building and managing virtual experiences with a focus on stability, core functionality, and ease of use.

### New features

- **Compliance checkboxes:** Added two new checkboxes to the sign-up flow, requiring the new user to agree to the iR Terms of Use, as well as consent to being 13+ age or older for legal compliance.
- **Analytics:** Added project-level analytics for all iR creators to help view and understand the performance of their projects.
- **Project sharing:** Added the ability for iR creators to share their projects with friends & family for easy collaboration.

### Improvements

- **Asynchronous update:** Made updates to the user sign-up flow to allow quicker page load times and move through the entire process from start to finish much quicker.
- **Search results:** Made an improvement to the console UI that makes it clear when a user searches through their projects if no search results are found.
- **Default scene:** Made updates so that when an iR creator creates a new project, a default scene is also generated.

### Fixes

- **Sub-domain propagation:** Fixed a bug where the sub-domains that were being auto-generated were over the 64-character limit and would display an error message to the user.

- **Help widget:** Fixed a bug that prevented the Help widget from being displayed to users in the iR console.

### Known issues
