Discover the latest platform improvements and bug fixes for the iR Engine.

## 1.0 - September 2024

> **Release date:** 2024/08/09

### Summary

This inaugural release of the iR Engine lays the foundation for building and managing virtual experiences with a focus on stability, core functionality, and ease of use.

### New features

- **Compliance checkboxes:** Added two new checkboxes to the sign-up flow, requiring the new user to agree to the iR Terms of Use, as well as consent to being 13+ age or older for legal compliance.
- **Analytics:** Added project-level analytics for all iR creators to help view and understand the performance of their projects.
- **Project sharing:** Added the ability for iR creators to share their projects with friends & family for easy collaboration.

### Improvements

- **Asynchronous update:** Made updates to the user sign-up flow to allow quicker page load times and move through the entire process from start to finish much quicker.
- **Search results:** Made an improvement to the console UI that makes it clear when a user searches through their projects if no search results are found.
- **Default scene:** Made updates so that when an iR creator creates a new project, a default scene is also generated.

### Fixes

- **Sub-domain propagation:** Fixed a bug where the sub-domains that were being auto-generated were over the 64-character limit and would display an error message to the user.
- **Apple SSO:** Fixed a bug that was preventing the Apple SSO option from working properly.
- **Help widget:** Fixed a bug that prevented the Help widget from being displayed to users in the iR console.

### Known issues

- **Mobile responsiveness:** In this version, the iR Studio performs best on a desktop machine, but future releases will include enhancements to the mobile responsiveness.
- **Locations:** Currently, iR creators cannot view their published locations. In the future, these will be displayed in the iR console UI.
- **Signup page UI:** Improvements will be made to the signup page UI to not only make it more intuitive but also include more detailed error messages to help users troubleshoot themselves if they have issues.
