### Materials

Properties applied to 3D models in the iR Engine that define their appearance, including color, roughness, reflectivity(metalness), and transparency. Materials use shaders to simulate how surfaces interact with light, contributing to the realism of the scene.

### Mocap (motion capture)

The process of recording movement data from real-world performers to animate characters in the iR Engine. Mocap data captures the nuances of human motion, bringing lifelike animations to digital characters.

### Mount points

Predefined attachment points on objects that allow other entities, such as avatars, to seamlessly attach in the iR Engine to the predefined object object (e.g., sitting in a chair). Mount points facilitate interactions and animations involving multiple objects.

### Motion blur

An effect that simulates the blurring of moving objects, adding a sense of speed and motion. The iR Engine uses motion blur to make animations appear smoother and more dynamic.

### No-code

An approach to content creation within the iR Engine that minimizes the need for programming. It relies on templates, visual tools, and AI assistance, making our engine more accessible to non-technical users while accelerating the development process.

### Performance capture
