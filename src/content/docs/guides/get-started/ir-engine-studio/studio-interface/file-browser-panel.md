The **File Browser** panel in IR Engine's Studio organizes and manages your project's files. It contains all the system files you need to run your scenes, as well as your manually uploaded assets.

You can access the engine’s file browser through the **Files** tab:

:::note
Because the **Files** tab contains crucial system files to run your engine, all the files outside of assets  and public folders are read-only and cannot be modified.

## Visualizing your assets

Assets inside the **File Browser** and **Assets Panel** have icons to provide a visual reference. We recommend using the **Assets** tab to view all files available for use in your scene. Upon import, you can choose to add imported files to your **User Library**.
