This guide walks you through the process of publishing your store in the iR Engine.

## Publishing your store

After building and configuring your virtual store, the final step is to publish it. Publishing your store makes it accessible to users via a web link, known as **Location**, allowing them to explore and interact with your creation.

## Step 1. Prepare your scene for publication

Before publishing, ensure that your scene is complete and all elements are properly configured. This includes:

- Verifying that all products are correctly loaded and positioned.
- Checking that video and audio components function as expected.
- Ensuring the overall look and feel of your store meets your desired standards.

## Step 2. Publish your store

**To publish your store:**

1. **Open the publishing menu:** In the Studio interface, locate the **Publish** button at the top right of the screen.

    2. Fill in the necessary details for your virtual space; define maximum users, along with video, audio, and screen sharing options, and choose the type of location:
        - **Private**: Only users with specific access can enter.
        - **Public**: Anyone with the link can access the Location.
        - **Showroom**: A special type of public Location designed for demonstrations.
3. **Save and publish:** After configuring the details, click **Save and Publish**. This action creates a new virtual space link for your store.
4. **Retrieve the link:**
    1. Once the publishing process is complete, the window displays the link to your virtual store at the top center.
    2. Copy this link to share it with your users.
