1. **Locate your project on the My Projects page:**
    - Navigate to the **My Projects** page in the iR Engine Console.
    - Find the project you want to use for building your store.
2. **Open project settings:**

4. **Enter your Storefront Access Token:**
    - In the Shopify integration settings, locate the **Storefront Access Token** text field.
    - Enter your Shopify Storefront Access Token. It should look like this: `4beffe41538252a1dde4a6a881857782`.

5. **Enter your Store Name:**
    - Find the **Store Name** field and enter your Shopify domainâ€™s base URL (e.g., `{store_name}`).
    - Retrieve this element from the URL of your **Shopify Admin**, typically found as `{store_name}.myshopify.com/admin`.

6. **Save your settings:**
    - After entering the necessary information, click the **Save** button to finalize the integration settings.

Completing these integration settings allows the iR Engine to access and load all the items available in your Shopify store, including 2D and 3D models. This integration is essential for placing your products into any of your virtual scenes.
